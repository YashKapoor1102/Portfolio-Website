# Portfolio Website 

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and experience as a software engineer. I developed this website utilizing TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, incorporating Material UI (now known as MUI) for the icons and UI components. The website is deployed on Vercel.
